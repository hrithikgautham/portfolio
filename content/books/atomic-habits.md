* Aggregation of marginal gains: If you broke your final goal into different tasks, try to make at least 1% marginal gain in each of the task, You get a significant increase when you put them all together.
* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure.
* Your daily small choices will compound 20-30 yrs down the line.
* Habit is a double edged sword. Good habits leads to improvement.

* Plateau of latent potential: There will be a dormant period during which you might think that the efforts you have put in is not yielding any results. Your work is not wasted, it is being stored.
* “When nothing seems to be working, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away his rock, perhaps a hunter times without even a crack showing up in it. Yet at the 101 time it will split into 2, and I know that it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before”.

* Goal is about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
* Focus more on your System that your goals.
* Fall in love with the process than the end result. When your habit is focussed around the end result, you stop doing it as soon as the goal is achieved. But when you love the prices, no matter what your goal is, you’ll always find yourself doing the habit.
