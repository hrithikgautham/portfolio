## Summary: 

* If the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.
* If you have 2 tasks one harder and one easier, force yourself to start with the harder task.
* Discipline yourself to begin immediately and then to persist until the task is over before you switch to next task.
* One of the worst use of your time is doing something very well that need not be done at all.
* “If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step just gets us to the wrong place faster.”
* Seven step rule:
    * Decide exactly what u want.
    * Write it down.
    * Set a deadline on your goal.
    * Male a list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal.
    * Organise the list into plan.
    * Take action on your plan immediately.
    * Resolve to do something every single day that move you towards your final goal.
* “Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now”.
* Proper prior planning prevents poor performance.
* 10/90 rule: The first 10% of your time that you spend planning and organising before you begin your work will save you as much as 90% of the time in getting the job done once you get started.
* 80/20 rule: 20% of your activity will account for 80% of your results.
* Long term thinking improves short term decision making.
* Ask yourself “What are the potential consequences of doing or not doing this job?”
* Winners make sacrifices in the short term so that they can enjoy far greater rewards in the long term.
* Losers try to escape from fear and drudgery with activities that are tension releiving.
* Law of forced efficiency: There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do most important thing.
* There will never be enough time to do earthing you have to do.
* Three questions for maximum productivity:
    * What are my highest value activities?
    * What can I do if done well, will make a real difference?
    * What is the most valuable use of my time right now?
* The things that matter the most should never be at the mercy of the things the matter least.
* Creative procrastination is the act of thoughtfully deciding upon the exact things you are not going to do right now.
* When every physical and mental resource is focused, ones power to solve a problem multiplies tremendously.
* Ask yourself “What one skill if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greater positive impact on my career?”.
* If you want to increase rewards, you must focus on increasing the value of what you do.
* It is the quality of time at work that counts, and the quantity of time at home that matters.
* By the yard its hard, but inch by inch, anything’s a cinch!
* The only certain means of success is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be.
* Continuous learning is the minimum requirement for success in any field.
* What is it in me that is holding me back?
* It is not what happens to you, but the way you interpret things happening to you determines how you feel.
* “The last of human freedom is to choose ones attitude any given set of circumstances”.
* “Do it now! Do it now! Do it now!”
*
