## Summary: 

* Virality isn’t born, its made.
* People are more likely to share messages that make them look cool, smart etc.
* People talk about the things that comes to mind. For eg when we think of dogs, we also think of cats.
* When we care, we share. Things that evoke certain feeling are more likely to be shared. Sometimes negative emotions are also shared.
* Your product has to show people how it saves time and how it is better than other products in the market.
* You need to highlight the incredible value your product provides, monetarily and otherwise.
* The most powerful marketing is personal recommendation. Nothing is more viral or contagious than a friend suggesting you that he had a great time at that place.
* Sharing personal info activates the same brain circuits that respond to reward like food and money.
* Unusual and remarkable things are shared more often.
* When we say a past story to someone, we may not remember all the parts of it. So we fill some our own guesses which makes the story more exaggerated.
* We talk about things that exceeds our expectations. For eg: If the flight is at a cheaper price, we expect the seats to be smaller, no snacks, drinks etc. But if the flight has bigger seats and the offer snacks drink, then we have something to recommend to our friends.
* Game mechanics force us to do things. Game mechanics make us look good infront of others.
* People just dont care how well they are doing, they care how well the are doing with respect to others.
* Scarcity: Limited in supply.
* Exclucivity: Available to only certain group of people.
* Scarcity and exclusivity boos word of mouth marketing.
* When people possess something not lot of people has it it makes them feel special, and they tell others about it. Why? Because it makes them feel good.
* If something isn’t readily available can make people value it more.
* Marketing is about tapping into peoples genuine enthusiasm for products and services that they find useful.
* 2 types of word of mouth marketing: Immediate and on-going.
* Immediate word-of-mouth means sharing the product information as soon as you learn about it. For eg: Movies. If the goodness of the movie is not shared with others sooner, the movie will be no longer screened and other movies take its place.
* Negative word of mouth also increase sales because it makes think of the product or service.
* Linking a product or idea with a stimulus that is already associated with many things isn’t as effective as forging a more effective and original link.
* “The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. It is the power of all try art and science.” - Albert Einstein.
* Arousal is a state of activation and readiness for action.
* Arousal leads to oversharing of information.
* If its hard to see what others are doing, its hard to imitate. Making something more observable makes it easier to imitate.
* Behaviour is public and thoughts are private.
* Behavioural residue is a physical traces or remnants that most actions or behaviour leave in their wake.
* By simply clicking the line button on the Facebook post, people not only show their affinity with a product, idea, or organisation, they also help spread the word that something is good or worth paying attention to.
* Prospect theory: people evaluate thing in absolute terms.
* If 2 commodities, A and B has similar features, people will buy the one which has more discount, even though the after discount price of the other is lesser than the one bought.
* Diminishing sensitivity: People value the money lesser the more they move away from the reference point.
* Learning through stories: The fastest way for us to learn about something is to listen to others stories.
* Stories provide a quick and easy way o acquire a knowledge in a vivid and engaging fashion.
* Information travels under the guise of what seems like idle chatter.
* 6 ***STEPPS*** to contagiousness:
    * Social currency: We share things that make us look good.
    * Triggers: Top of mind, tip of tongue.
    * Emotion: When we care, we share.
    * Public: Built to show, Built to grow.
    * Practical value: News you can use.
    * Stories: Information travels under the guise of idle chatter.
