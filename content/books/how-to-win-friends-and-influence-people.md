## Summary: 

* Appreciate people around you. Stop criticising them.Charles schwab: ***“my greatest asset is the ability to arouse enthusiasm in others by appreciating them”***.
* Flattery is not as same as appreciation. One is selfish, the other is unselfish. One is admired, the other is condemned. ***“Don’t be afraid of enemy who attack you, be afraid of a friend who flatters you”***.
* Flattery is like telling the other person what he thinks about himself.
* Arouse the eager need in others. He who does this has to whole world behind him. He who does not walks a lonely path.
* If you want someone to do something for you. You have to tell them in such way that the thing that need to be done must align with their interest. In other words, you have to make them do what they want to do.
* A simple smile goes a long way. When u smile at random people, they smile back at you. Realtionships improve when you have a genuine smile on your face.
* People immensely love their name. People love it when you call by their name. Propel love it when you associate their name with any thing. “Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language”
* To be a good conversationalist you have to listen more than talking.
* Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
* Always talk in other persons view point.
* Always trouble yourself to find what others like and start a conversation on that topic. It goes a long way. 
* Make the other person feel important, and do it sincerely. “Hearty in approbation and lavish in praise”.
* The only way to get best of an argument is to avoid it. If you lose the argument, you lose. If you win the argument, you hurt other persons pride. He may not seek to be friends with you later. So you lose.
* If the other person is wrong, dont say they’re wrong to their face. Look at the situation from their view and act accordingly. Instead, try to appreciate about the part where they are right.
* If you are wrong, just admit it before the other person gets chance to condemn you. This will make the other person support you even though mistake is on your side.
* “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall”.
* A persons starting a conversation by saying “No” is unlikely to  agree on your view later. Make the person say “Yes”, then try to convey your ideas to them. They are more likely to converge on your thoughts.
* Let the other person do the talking. Stop boating about your achieve meant to others. You’d think that would grab more attention towards you. But In reality you’ll lose friends. “If you want enemies, excel your friends. If you want friends, let your friends excel you”.
* Let he other person think that the idea is his/hers. But in reality, the idea was your own.
* Try to see thing from other persons POV.
* Dramatise your ideas when necessary to grab their attention.
* Point out peoples mistakes indirectly.
* Talk about your own mistake before criticising others.
* Dont give orders, instead give suggestions.
* Appreciate the slightest improvement.
* Give the other person a good reputation to live up to.
* Encourage others so that it motivates them to move forward. Make the others feel that the things they feel is hard to achieve is easier than they thought it would be. Make the fault seem easier to correct.
* ***“I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again”.***
