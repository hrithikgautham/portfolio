```“You never can tell what a thought will do in bringing you hate or love. For thoughts are things and their airy wings are swifter than carrier doves. They follow the law of universe. Each thing creates its kind, And the speed over the track to bring you back whatever went out from your mind.”``` - ***Ella Wheeler Wilcox***.
