Think of saturation as the intensity of the color. When you buy new clothes, the colors are bright and vibrant. It has high saturation. After washing the clothes for like 10 times, The color becomes dull. Now we say the saturation is low. If the saturation is completely remove, the image becomes black and white. Whether a pixel becomes black or white depends on the luminosity level of that particular pixel.
